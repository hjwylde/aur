# Arch User Repository build files

This repository contains the build files for some [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/ "Arch User Repository") packages.
The repository merely contains the build files, I do not claim ownership of any source files of the products.
Licenses are provided where required.

The following packages are currently maintained by myself (Henry J. Wylde):
* wdk
* wdk-src
